##Proof-of-concept, MQTT as language link  

The files in this repository are part of a proof of concept for building browser based User Interfaces using MQTT.  

For a detailed disctiption and instructions for using these files please see the blog post [Building a browser based User Interface with MQTT](http://xperimentia.com/2015/08/20/building-a-browser-based-user-interface-with-mqtt/)  

Although the instructions are focused on setting up MQTT on a Raspberry Pi they shuld also be suitable, with slight modifications, for other Linux system.
